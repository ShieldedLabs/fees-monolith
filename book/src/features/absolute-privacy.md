# Absolute Privacy

NozyWallet enforces **complete privacy by default**. This means every transaction is automatically private - you cannot accidentally send a transparent transaction that would reveal your financial information.

## How Privacy Works

### Shielded Transactions Only

Unlike other Zcash wallets that support both transparent and shielded transactions, NozyWallet **only supports shielded transactions**. This ensures:

- **No transparent addresses** - You cannot receive or send from transparent addresses
- **All transactions are private** - Every transaction uses zero-knowledge proofs
- **No privacy mistakes** - You cannot accidentally compromise your privacy

### Zero-Knowledge Proofs

All NozyWallet transactions use Zcash's **Orchard protocol**, which provides:

- **Sender privacy**: Your address is hidden
- **Receiver privacy**: Recipient address is hidden
- **Amount privacy**: Transaction amounts are hidden
- **Cryptographic proofs**: Privacy is mathematically guaranteed, not just obfuscated

### Untraceable Transactions

Every transaction is completely untraceable:

- **No transaction graph** - Cannot link transactions together
- **No address reuse** - New addresses for every transaction
- **No metadata leakage** - No information exposed on blockchain

## Best Practices

To maintain maximum privacy:

1. **Use unique addresses** - Generate a new address for each transaction
2. **Don't reuse addresses** - Address reuse can reduce privacy
3. **Run your own node** - Use your own Zebra node for maximum privacy
4. **Keep software updated** - Security updates protect your privacy
5. **Backup securely** - Protect your mnemonic phrase offline

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I send transparent transactions?**  
A: No. NozyWallet only supports shielded transactions to ensure complete privacy.

**Q: Is my privacy guaranteed?**  
A: Yes, as long as you follow best practices (unique addresses, secure backups, etc.).

**Q: How does this compare to Monero?**  
A: Privacy levels are equivalent, but Zcash offers faster block times and lower fees.

**Q: What if I need transparent transactions?**  
A: For transparent transactions, you would need to use a different wallet. However, transparent transactions compromise privacy.
