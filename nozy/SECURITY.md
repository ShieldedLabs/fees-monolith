---

##  Security Audits

### Self-Audit Status

**Status:** ✅ **Completed** (December 2025)

We have completed a comprehensive self-security audit covering:
- Code security patterns (unsafe blocks, unwrap() calls, panics)
- Cryptographic implementation review
- Input validation and error handling
- Dependency security
- Storage and encryption security

**Results:** See [SELF_AUDIT_RESULTS.md](SELF_AUDIT_RESULTS.md) for detailed findings.

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ No critical security vulnerabilities found
- ✅ No unsafe code blocks in production
- ✅ Uses trusted cryptographic libraries (Zcash, Argon2, AES-256-GCM)
- ⚠️ 93 unwrap() calls identified (remediation in progress)

###  Third-Party Audit Required

**Status:**  **Planned for Production**

While self-audits are valuable, **a professional third-party security audit is essential** before production deployment of a cryptocurrency wallet.

#### Why Third-Party Audits Matter

1. **Expert Analysis** - Independent security experts identify issues self-audits may miss
2. **Cryptographic Review** - Specialized review of cryptographic implementations
3. **Penetration Testing** - Simulated attacks to find vulnerabilities
4. **Industry Standards** - Certification and compliance with security standards
5. **User Trust** - Public audit reports build confidence
6. **Grant Requirements** - Often required for Zcash Foundation grants

#### Audit Timeline

**Current Status:** Planning phase

**Target Timeline:**
- **Q1 2026**: Engage audit firm

**Process:**
1. **Report** - Submit vulnerability report
2. **Acknowledge** - We acknowledge receipt
3. **Investigate** - We investigate and verify
4. **Remediate** - We fix the vulnerability
5. **Disclose** - We coordinate public disclosure
6. **Credit** - We credit you (if desired)

### Vulnerability Severity

##  Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep Software Updated**
   - Always use the latest version
   - Check for security updates regularly

2. **Secure Your Wallet**
   - Use strong passwords
   - Enable password protection
   - **CRITICAL: Backup your mnemonic securely** (see below)

3. **Mnemonic Backup Security** ⚠️ **CRITICAL**
   
   **Your mnemonic phrase is the ONLY way to recover your wallet. If lost, funds are PERMANENTLY lost.**
   
   **✅ DO:**
   - Write mnemonic on paper (never digitally)
   - Store in secure, fireproof location
   - Make multiple copies in different locations
   - Verify backup by restoring (on testnet first)
   - Use hardware wallets for production
   
   **❌ NEVER:**
   - Store mnemonic digitally (screenshots, photos, cloud, email)
   - Share mnemonic with anyone (not even support)
   - Enter mnemonic on shared/public computers
   - Store mnemonic in password managers
   - Take photos or screenshots of mnemonic
   
   **⚠️  If someone gets your mnemonic, they can steal ALL your funds.**

4. **Verify Downloads**
   - Only download from official sources
   - Verify checksums before installation
   - Check GPG signatures (when available)

5. **Network Security**
   - Use trusted networks
   - Consider using Tor for additional privacy
   - Verify Zebra node connection

6. **Private Key Security**
   - Never share your mnemonic
   - Store backups securely (see mnemonic backup above)
   - Use hardware wallets (when available)
   - **Keys are automatically zeroized** after use (memory security)

### For Developers

1. **Code Security**
   - Follow Rust security best practices
   - **Use `cargo audit` regularly** - Integrated into CI/CD
   - Review dependencies carefully
   - Fix vulnerabilities before merging

2. **Dependency Security**
   - **Automated scanning** - `cargo audit` runs in CI on every push
   - **Weekly audits** - Scheduled scans for new vulnerabilities
   - **Release blocking** - Releases blocked if vulnerabilities found
   - **Update promptly** - Fix vulnerabilities as soon as they're found

2. **Cryptographic Security**
   - Use only trusted cryptographic libraries
   - Never implement custom cryptography
   - Follow Zcash protocol specifications

3. **Error Handling**
   - Never log sensitive data
   - Use proper error types
   - Provide user-friendly messages

4. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Sanitize data before processing
   - Use type-safe APIs
