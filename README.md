# NozyWallet

**Orchard-first Zcash wallet** — CLI, desktop app, and browser extension. This repository is a **wallet and companion services**, not a consensus node.

## What NozyWallet is

NozyWallet helps you create and restore a **shielded Orchard wallet**, scan for incoming notes, build transactions, and (on supported surfaces) send ZEC. The project **does not ship a full blockchain node**. You run **[Zebra](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra) (`zebrad`)** for JSON-RPC and **[lightwalletd](https://github.com/zcash/lightwalletd)** for compact blocks, then point the wallet at those endpoints.

**Privacy policy in the wallet:** transparent `t1` addresses are **rejected** for user-facing send/receive flows; the product is **shielded-first** (Orchard / unified `u1`), not a mixed transparent wallet. That is a design choice, not a claim of “Monero equivalence.”

| Surface | Path | Role |
|--------|------|------|
| **CLI + core library** | `nozy` (`src/`, root `Cargo.toml`) | Wallet logic, `ZebraClient`, transaction building |
| **Zeaking** | `zeaking/` | Compact sync via lightwalletd → SQLite (`zeaking::lwd`) |
| **API server** | `api-server/` | Localhost HTTP companion (`nozywallet-api`, default `:3000`) |
| **Desktop** | `desktop-client/` | Tauri app (recommended full UX today) |
| **Browser extension** | `browser-extension/` | MV3 + WASM; compact sync via companion API |
| **Mobile (in progress)** | `zeaking-ffi/` | UniFFI bindings; not on app stores yet |
| **Landing site** | `landing/` | Marketing/docs site only — **not** the wallet |

**Recommended stack:** `zebrad` (RPC, typically `:8232`) + `lightwalletd` (gRPC, typically `:9067`) + Nozy. Architecture and limits: [`ZEBRAD_SHIELDED_SEND_LIMIT.md`](ZEBRAD_SHIELDED_SEND_LIMIT.md). Windows dev helpers: [`scripts/README.md`](scripts/README.md) (`run-nozy-api.ps1`, `zeaking-lwd-smoke.ps1`).

**Contributor priority:** new feature work is **extension-first** ([`EXTENSION_FIRST_SCOPE.md`](EXTENSION_FIRST_SCOPE.md)). **End users** who want a full wallet today should prefer **desktop** or **CLI**; the extension is a lighter mode that relies on the companion API for LWD sync ([`browser-extension/COMPANION.md`](browser-extension/COMPANION.md)).

## Node operator FAQ

**Does Nozy require a fully synced Zebra node before wallet sync can begin?**

**No.** Wallet sync is **incremental** and **node-tip-relative**. Nozy does not wait for `zebrad` to reach network tip before scanning or downloading compact blocks. It syncs from your chosen start height (or last scanned height) up to **whatever height your node stack reports now** — then you run sync again as `zebrad` catches up.

| Activity | Needs full network sync? |
|----------|---------------------------|
| Start scanning / compact download | **No** — only up to **node tip** |
| See incoming notes in recent blocks | Node must have validated those blocks |
| Shielded send (witness + anchor) | Node must have blocks through your **anchor height** (`z_gettreestate`) |
| Reliable broadcast / mempool | Practically **near network tip** |
| “Balance at chain tip” | Really **balance at node tip** until the node catches up |

**Two sync paths in Nozy:**

| Path | Tip source | Used by |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Direct RPC scan** | `zebrad` `getblockcount` | CLI `nozy sync`, API `/api/sync` |
| **Compact / LWD** | lightwalletd `GetLatestBlock` | `zeaking::lwd`, API `/api/lwd/sync/compact-to-tip`, extension companion |

Nozy does **not** check “fully synced”, `verificationprogress`, or lightwalletd `estimatedHeight` — only the current served tip.

**Zebrad below wallet birthday (e.g. node at ~12k, birthday ~3.07M)**

**Expected.** Nozy scans from birthday (or `last_scan_height+1`) **up to zebrad tip only**. If tip &lt; birthday, sync errors — Orchard scan cannot run on blocks your node does not have yet. Wallet create/`receive` still work; balance and notes appear after `zebrad` passes birthday height. For mainnet pilot testing, use a **snapshot** near chain tip or **testnet**; do not expect mainnet receive at tip while `zebrad` is at block 12k.

**Minimum to start wallet sync**

- `zebrad` JSON-RPC reachable (default `:8232`); `getblockcount` returns a sensible height.
- **Recommended:** `zebrad` + **lightwalletd** (gRPC, default `:9067`) on the same network (mainnet/testnet).
- Optional: `nozywallet-api` on `:3000` for desktop/extension LWD routes.

**Practical setup for testers**

1. Start `zebrad` (snapshot or from genesis).
2. Start **lightwalletd** once RPC is up — it does not need 100% sync.
3. Create/restore wallet; set **`--start-height`** (wallet birthday) on mainnet to avoid scanning from ~3M by default.
4. Run **`nozy sync`** (or LWD compact-to-tip) **while** `zebrad` keeps indexing; repeat until node tip is near network tip.
5. For **sends**, wait until the node is close to network tip and you have scanned through spendable notes.

Incremental CLI sync without `--start-height` scans **~1,000 blocks per run** (testnet default start: height `1`). See [`ZEBRAD_SHIELDED_SEND_LIMIT.md`](ZEBRAD_SHIELDED_SEND_LIMIT.md) for shielded-send architecture.

**Stale compact cache:** If `nozy status` shows compact heights **above** the LWD tip, run `nozy lwd prune` (or `nozy lwd sync-to-tip`, which prunes automatically). Then re-download with `nozy lwd sync-to-tip --start-floor <birthday>`.

**After receiving funds:** run `nozy sync --to-tip` (not plain `sync` — that only advances ~1000 blocks per run on mainnet).

**Verify:** `nozy status` shows Zebra tip, RPC last scan, LWD tip, and compact-cache height. Integration tests (require live node): `cargo test --test integration_tests -- --ignored test_sync_follows_zebra_tip` and `test_lwd_compact_sync_follows_tip` — see [`tests/integration_tests.rs`](tests/integration_tests.rs).

**Extension releases:** maintainers publish Chromium/Firefox zips via the **extension-release-bundles** workflow — see [`browser-extension/RELEASES.md`](browser-extension/RELEASES.md).

## Privacy stance (what the code actually enforces)

- **Shielded-first:** Orchard / unified shielded receivers; transparent `t1` is blocked for sends (see `src/privacy.rs`).
- **Orchard proofs:** Halo 2 proving is built into the Orchard stack (no legacy Sapling parameter download).
- **Operational privacy** still depends on how you run your node, network, and device security — this wallet does not replace full-network anonymity guarantees.

##  Quick Start

### 1. Create a New Wallet

```bash
cargo run --bin nozy new
```

**Example output (illustrative — your mnemonic and addresses will differ):**
```
 Creating new wallet...
 Wallet created successfully!

  **CRITICAL SECURITY WARNING: MNEMONIC BACKUP**

**Your mnemonic phrase is the ONLY way to recover your wallet. If you lose it, you will PERMANENTLY lose access to all your funds.**

**🔒 Security Best Practices:**
- ✅ **Write it down** on paper (never store digitally)
- ✅ **Store in a secure location** (fireproof safe, bank deposit box)
- ✅ **Never share it** with anyone (not even support staff)
- ✅ **Never take screenshots** or photos of your mnemonic
- ✅ **Never store it online** (cloud, email, notes apps)
- ✅ **Make multiple copies** and store in different secure locations
- ✅ **Verify the backup** by restoring from it (on testnet first)

**⚠️  If someone gets your mnemonic, they can steal ALL your funds. Treat it like cash.**

 Your 24-word mnemonic phrase:
nozy nozy nozy nozy nozy nozy nozy nozy nozy nozy nozy nozy nozy nozy nozy nozy
nozy nozy nozy nozy nozy nozy nozy  about
[24 words total - KEEP THIS SECURE!]

 Set password protection? (y/n): y
Enter password: ********
Confirm password: ********
 Password set successfully

 Generated Orchard address:
u1testaddress1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz...

 Wallet saved to: ~/.local/share/nozy/data/wallet.dat
```

This will:
- Generate a new HD wallet with BIP39 mnemonic
- Ask if you want password protection
- Create a sample Orchard address
- Save the wallet to the secure data directory

### 2. Restore from Mnemonic

```bash
cargo run --bin nozy restore
```

**Example Output:**
```
📝 Enter your 24-word 

mnemonic phrase:
> abandon abandon abandon ... [enter all 24 words]

 Enter wallet password (if set): ********
 Wallet restored successfully!
 Your addresses are ready to use.
```

Enter your 24-word mnemonic phrase to restore your wallet.

### 3. Generate Addresses

```bash
cargo run --bin nozy addresses --count 5
```

**Example Output:**
```
 Generating 5 Orchard addresses...

Address 0: u1testaddress1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz...
Address 1: u1testaddress2345678901bcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzab...
Address 2: u1testaddress3456789012cdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabc...
Address 3: u1testaddress4567890123defghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcd...
Address 4: u1testaddress5678901234efghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcde...

 Generated 5 addresses
```

Generate multiple Orchard addresses for receiving ZEC.

### 4. Scan for Notes

```bash
cargo run --bin nozy scan --start-height 1000000 --end-height 1000100
```

**Example Output:**
```
 Scanning blockchain for notes...
 Progress: [████████████████████] 100%

 Scan complete!
 Found 3 notes
 Total balance: 0.50000000 ZEC

Notes found:
  - Note 1: 0.20000000 ZEC (height 1000045)
  - Note 2: 0.20000000 ZEC (height 1000067)
  - Note 3: 0.10000000 ZEC (height 1000098)

 Notes saved to: ~/.local/share/nozy/data/notes.json
```

Scan the blockchain for incoming shielded notes.

### 5. Manage Proving Parameters

```bash
# Check proving status
cargo run --bin nozy proving --status

# Download placeholder parameters (for testing)
cargo run --bin nozy proving --download
```

**Example Output:**
```
🔧 Orchard Proving Parameters Management
=====================================

 Proving Status:
   Spend Parameters: ✅
   Output Parameters: ✅
   Spend Verifying Key: ✅
   Output Verifying Key: ✅
   Can Prove: ✅

 Orchard proving ready (Halo 2 - no external parameters required)
```

Manage Orchard proving parameters for transaction creation.

### 6. Send ZEC

```bash
cargo run --bin nozy send --recipient "u1..." --amount 0.1
# Opt-in priority fee (ZIP-317 standard × 4, ~2-block expiry):
cargo run --bin nozy send --recipient "u1..." --amount 0.1 --priority
```

Fees are computed **client-side** (ZIP-317). Zebrad does not implement `estimatefee`; the wallet no longer uses a fixed 10k zat fallback for sends.

**Complete Transaction Flow Example:**

```bash
$ cargo run --bin nozy send --recipient "u1testrecipient1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" --amount 0.1

Transaction Summary
============================================================
  Recipient: u1testrecipient1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
  Amount:    0.1 ZEC
  Network:   MAINNET ⚠️

 Estimating transaction fee...

 Transaction saved to history - will track confirmations

 Remaining balance: 0.39999000 ZEC
```

**Mainnet Broadcasting Safety:**

NozyWallet requires explicit confirmation before broadcasting transactions on mainnet to prevent accidental loss of funds:

- **Testnet**: Type `yes` to confirm (safe for testing)
- **Mainnet**: Type `SEND` (all caps) to confirm (sends real ZEC)

**To enable mainnet broadcasting:**

1. **Set network to mainnet:**
   ```bash
   cargo run --bin nozy config --set-network mainnet
   ```

2. **When sending, confirm by typing `SEND`:**
   ```bash
   cargo run --bin nozy send --recipient "u1..." --amount 0.1
   # When prompted, type: SEND
   ```

**For testing (recommended):**

```bash
# Set network to testnet
cargo run --bin nozy config --set-network testnet

# Send on testnet (requires typing 'yes' to confirm)
cargo run --bin nozy send --recipient "u1..." --amount 0.1
```

**Check current network:**

```bash
cargo run --bin nozy config --show
```

## 💡 Real-World Usage Examples

### Complete Wallet Setup and Transaction Flow

Here's a complete example of setting up a wallet and sending a transaction:

```bash
# Step 1: Create a new wallet
$ cargo run --bin nozy new
# [Follow prompts to create wallet and set password]

# Step 2: Generate a receiving address
$ cargo run --bin nozy addresses --count 1
📍 Address 0: u1yourreceivingaddress1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz...

# Step 3: Share your address to receive ZEC
# Send the address above to someone who wants to send you ZEC

# Step 4: Scan for incoming notes (after receiving ZEC)
$ cargo run --bin nozy scan --start-height 2000000 --end-height 2100000
# This scans the blockchain for notes sent to your addresses

# Step 5: Check your balance
$ cargo run --bin nozy balance
💰 Balance: 1.50000000 ZEC
📝 Notes: 5 spendable notes

# Step 6: Send ZEC to someone
$ cargo run --bin nozy send --recipient "u1recipientaddress..." --amount 0.5
# [Follow prompts to confirm transaction]

# Step 7: Check transaction history
$ cargo run --bin nozy history
📜 Transaction History:
  TXID: abc123... | Amount: 0.5 ZEC | Status: ✅ Confirmed (3 confirmations)
```

### Automated Transaction Script

For programmatic usage, see the [API Documentation](API_DOCUMENTATION.md) for complete Rust examples:

```rust
use nozy::{HDWallet, ZebraClient, OrchardTransactionBuilder, ZebraJsonRpcOrchardWitnessProvider, NoteScanner};
use nozy::WalletStorage;
use std::path::PathBuf;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> nozy::NozyResult<()> {
    // 1. Load wallet
    let storage = WalletStorage::with_xdg_dir();

## 🔧 Configuration

### Network Settings

Configure whether to use mainnet (real ZEC) or testnet (test ZEC):

```bash
# Set to mainnet (default)
cargo run --bin nozy config --set-network mainnet

# Set to testnet (for testing)
cargo run --bin nozy config --set-network testnet

# Show current configuration
cargo run --bin nozy config --show
```

**Important Notes:**
- **Mainnet**: Requires typing `SEND` (all caps) to confirm transactions (sends real ZEC)
- **Testnet**: Requires typing `yes` to confirm transactions (safe for testing)
- Default network is `mainnet` - mainnet transactions require explicit confirmation to prevent accidental sends
- Always verify the network before sending transactions

### Zebra Node Setup

1. Install and run Zebra:
```bash
# Install Zebra
cargo install zebrad

# Run Zebra with RPC enabled
zebrad start --rpc.bind-addr 127.0.0.1:8232
```

2. Test connection:
```bash
cargo run --bin nozy test-zebra
```

### Proving Parameters Setup

**Important:** Orchard uses Halo 2 proving system which **does NOT require external proving parameters**. The proving system is built into the Orchard library and works automatically.

**No setup required!** Your wallet is ready for shielded transactions immediately.

**Verify Proving Status:**
   ```bash
   cargo run --bin nozy proving --status
   ```

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ Orchard proving ready (Halo 2 - no external parameters required)
```

**Note:** The `proving --download` command is kept for API compatibility but performs no downloads (Halo 2 doesn't need them). It will display an informational message explaining that no downloads are needed.

**Historical Note:** Earlier Zcash shielded designs relied on external proving-parameter downloads; Orchard with Halo 2 has proving built in and requires no external files.

### Configuration File

NozyWallet stores configuration in a JSON file. The location depends on your OS:

- **Linux**: `~/.config/nozy/config.json` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nozy/config.json`)

}
```

#### Error Handling

```rust
use nozy::{NozyError, NozyResult};

match result {
    Ok(value) => println!("Success: {:?}", value),
    Err(NozyError::NetworkError(msg)) => {
        println!("Network error: {}", msg);
        println!("💡 Try checking your Zebra connection");
    },
    Err(NozyError::AddressParsing(msg)) => {
        println!("Address error: {}", msg);
        println!("💡 Verify the address format (should start with 'u1')");
    },
    Err(NozyError::InsufficientFunds(msg)) => {
        println!("Insufficient funds: {}", msg);
        println!("💡 Run 'sync' to update your balance");
    },
    Err(e) => println!("Error: {}", e),
}
```

#### Note Management

```rust
use nozy::{NoteScanner, SpendableNote};

// Scan for notes in a range
let mut scanner = NoteScanner::new(wallet, zebra_client);
let (result, spendable_notes) = scanner.scan_notes(
    Some(2_000_000), // start height
    Some(2_100_000), // end height
).await?;

// Process found notes
for note in &spendable_notes {
    let value = note.orchard_note.note.value().inner();
    println!("Note value: {:.8} ZEC", value as f64 / 100_000_000.0);
    println!("Nullifier: {}", hex::encode(note.orchard_note.nullifier.to_bytes()));
}
```

#### Wallet Storage

```rust
use nozy::WalletStorage;
use std::path::PathBuf;

// Save wallet
let storage = WalletStorage::with_xdg_dir();
storage.save_wallet(&wallet, "password").await?;

// Load wallet
let loaded_wallet = storage.load_wallet("password").await?;

// Create backup
storage.create_backup("backups").await?;
```

##  Performance

NozyWallet includes performance optimizations for faster note scanning:

### Parallel Block Fetching

By default, NozyWallet fetches **5 blocks in parallel** during scanning, providing up to **5x speedup** for large scans.

**Configure Parallelism:**
```rust
let mut scanner = NoteScanner::new(wallet, zebra_client);
scanner.set_parallel_blocks(10); // Fetch 10 blocks in parallel (1-50 range)
scanner.enable_block_cache();    // Cache blocks for 1 hour
```

**Performance Impact:**
- Sequential: ~100ms per block = 100 seconds for 1000 blocks
- Parallel (5 blocks): ~20 seconds for 1000 blocks (**5x faster**)
- Parallel (10 blocks): ~12 seconds for 1000 blocks (**8x faster**)

### Block Caching

Blocks are cached for 1 hour to avoid redundant fetches:
- Faster rescans of the same blocks
- Reduced network traffic
- Lower load on Zebra node

**Enable Caching:**
```rust
scanner.enable_block_cache();
```

### Incremental Scanning

Use incremental scanning to only process new blocks:
```rust
let scanner = NoteScanner::with_index_file(wallet, client, &index_path)?;
// Only scans blocks after last_scanned_height
scanner.scan_notes(Some(last_height + 1), None).await?;
```

**📖 For detailed performance documentation, see [PERFORMANCE.md](PERFORMANCE.md)**

## 🔒 Security

### Security Audits

**Self-Audit:** ✅ Completed (December 2025)  
**Third-Party Audit:** 🎯 Planned for Production (Q1-Q2 2026)

NozyWallet has completed a comprehensive self-security audit. **A professional third-party security audit is planned before production release** to ensure the highest security standards.

**Audit Status:**
-  Self-audit completed - See [SELF_AUDIT_RESULTS.md](SELF_AUDIT_RESULTS.md)
-  Third-party audit planned - See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for details
-  Considering: Least Authority, Trail of Bits, or Zcash Foundation recommended auditors
-  Exploring grant funding via Zcash Foundation grants

** For complete security information, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)**  
** For key management details, see [KEY_MANAGEMENT.md](KEY_MANAGEMENT.md)**

### Password Protection

- Uses Argon2 for password hashing
- Salt is randomly generated for each wallet
- Passwords are never stored in plain text

### Wallet Storage

- Wallets are encrypted with AES-256-GCM
- Encryption key is derived from password
- Backup files are also encrypted

### Private Key Management

- Private keys are never stored in plain text
- Keys are derived from mnemonic using BIP32
- Spending keys are only loaded when needed
- **Memory Security**: Private keys are automatically zeroized after use using the `zeroize` crate
- **Secure Key Handling**: Sensitive data is cleared from memory to prevent memory dumps

**Regular Updates:**
```bash
# Check for outdated dependencies
cargo install cargo-outdated
cargo outdated

# Run security audit
cargo install cargo-audit
cargo audit

# Update dependencies (review changes first!)
cargo update
```

**CI Checks:**
- `Cargo.lock` is verified in CI to ensure reproducible builds
- Security audits run automatically on every PR
- Outdated dependency checks run weekly
- License compliance checks ensure MIT-compatible dependencies

### Dependency Update Workflow

1. **Check for updates:**
   ```bash
   cargo outdated
   ```

2. **Review security advisories:**
   ```bash
   cargo audit
   ```

3. **Update dependencies:**
   ```bash
   # Update specific crate
   cargo update -p crate-name
   
   # Update all dependencies
   cargo update
   ```

4. **Test after updates:**
   ```bash
   cargo test
   cargo build --release
   ```

5. **Commit Cargo.lock:**
   - Always commit `Cargo.lock` to ensure reproducible builds
   - CI will verify `Cargo.lock` is up to date

### Best Practices

- ✅ **Pin security-critical dependencies** - Use exact versions for crypto libraries
- ✅ **Regular security audits** - Run `cargo audit` weekly
- ✅ **Keep Cargo.lock committed** - Ensures reproducible builds
